                Gingerbread is claimed to have been brought to Europe in 992 CE by the Armenian monk Gregory of Nicopolis (also called Gregory Makar and Grégoire de Nicopolis).He left Nicopolis
                (in modern-day western Greece) to live in Bondaroy (north-central France),near the town of Pithiviers.He stayed there for seven years and taught gingerbread baking to French Christians
                 He died in 999.In the 13th century, gingerbread was brought to Sweden by German immigrants, and it also began to be made in Poland. In 15th-century Germany, a gingerbread guild 
                controlled production.Early references from the Vadstena Abbey show that the Swedish nuns 
                baked gingerbread to ease indigestion in 1444.It was the custom to bake white biscuits and paint them as window decorations.
